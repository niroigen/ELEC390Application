# ELEC390Application
Helping students finding available lab rooms

This is a school project where we are working on making students of Concordia University find the lab rooms with ease. 
Instead of looking at each door and see whether you can go in that lab this application will be of help.
This will provide the user with the ability to see the labs which they can go to currently, check the noise level, and see how many people are within a lab room.
It will also notify the user whether there will be a certain lab being held 15 minutes before it is being held.
